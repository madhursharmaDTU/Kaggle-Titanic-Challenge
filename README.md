Note: You'll need to make an account to access the data.
Some questions or insights we would like to obtain from the data.

So here's a list of questions I'll try to answer

First some basic questions:

1.) Who were the passengers on the Titanic? (Ages,Gender,Class,..etc)
2.) What deck were the passengers on and how does that relate to their class?
3.) Where did the passengers come from?
4.) Who was alone and who was with family?

Then dig deeper with a broader question:

5.) What factors helped someone survive the sinking?
and more...
